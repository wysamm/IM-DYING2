<p>Hi my name is Wynter. I live in the Bronx with my momma and pappa and younger sibling. I'm great at making omlettes and napping.</p>

	<h2>Games I like</h2>

  <p>Instead of going outside I prefer to be home and play video games. I like:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Pok√©mon</li>
  <li>Ace Attorney</li>
  <li>Mother series</li>
  </ul>

<p>I have no idea! </p>
<p>What if another virus peeks its head into the world again? Then what would 2020 have been for? What if the vaccine turns me to an orc and I end up looking like Shrek? Will I ever get to go on campus?</p>
